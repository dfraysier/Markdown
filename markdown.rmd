#Say Hello to Markdown
##My try at this may fail
I have always wondered how to make *italic* texts in RStudio.
Better yet, making them **bold** is a shocking feat. 
I never thought i would learn:

* how to make a title,
* bold and italic texts,
* and a list. 

All in R! The wonders we accomplish.
